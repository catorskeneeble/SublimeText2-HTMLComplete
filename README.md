Sublime Text 2 HTML Autocomplete

Sublime Text HTML Autocomplete is an incremental quality of life improvement for writing out HTML in Sublime Text 2. This updated file features a number of expansions for common libraries, adds some missing tags, adds/removes attributes, and adds/removes cursor tabs.

Please backup your original `html_completions.py` before replacing.
